You are expected to give, a technical feedback to the project as if it's a real life project in code review format. 

## Procedure

1. You fork this repo and make this repository private (duplicate the repository if it's necessary by using GitHub settings).
2. You do your :sparkles: work
3. Invite the [reviewers](#reviewers) as collaborators to your repository
3. You open up a [PR](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) at your **own** forked version of the repository (please consider an appropriate git workflow here).

## Project

In this project, you will have a news feed activity. It retrieves the data from the local JSON file.
JSON is parsed manually and elements has been created from the parsed data. 

All the logical operations are happening in `MyNewsActivity.kt` file and all the visual creation for the list items is happening in `news_item.xml` file. 
There is only one data class for `News` element and it's in model folder.

Application is written in Kotlin.

You are free to suggest any library or code snippet that you think that is going to be useful for the codebase. 
But please be sure add detailed information about your suggestions and why would they be useful. 

## Questions

You can open an [issue](https://github.com/motain/android_take_home_test/issues) if you have any troubles.
